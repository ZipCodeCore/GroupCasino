# Casino Simulation

* **Objective** - To create an casino simulation
* **Purpose** - To gain familiarity with general object orientation and design principles

* **Description**
    * View the [javadocs](https://zipcodecore.github.io/casino.maven/docs/index.html) for the program to become better oriented with its design
      * `https://zipcoder.github.io/casino.maven/docs/index.html`
    * Create a casino simulation by extending or removing the pre-built implementations.
    * It is advised that you create additional methods and classes to mediate any foreseen shortcomings of the prebuilt assets. 
    * Enforce the following features in your system:
        * Ensure a console-based interface is available to allow input from and output to the users
        * Ensure the `Casino` has a selection of at least 6 implementation of `GameInterface`.
        * Ensure `PlayerInterface` is garbage collected upon completing a respective `GameInterface`
            * `SlotsPlayer` should be garbage collected when `SlotsGame` is garbage collected.
            * `BlackJackPlayer` should be garbage collected when `BlackJackGame` is garbage collected.
        * Ensure all implementation of `PlayerInterface` have reference to a `CasinoAccount`
            * `CasinoAccount` should not be garbage collected when a `GameInterface` is garbage collected.
        * Ensure at least 6 different implementations of `GameInterface` and a respective `PlayerInterface` are defined.
        * Ensure at least 1 implementation of `GameInterface` does not involve gambling.
        * Ensure at least 3 implementations of `GameInterface` involve gambling.
           * Enable the player to wager a `balance` that can be persisted throughout different games; when a `GameInterface` is garbage collected, the owner of the `balance` should be able to play a new game with their new `balance`.
        * Ensure all games which should support more than 1 player, have the ability to do so.
        * Ensure there are at least 80% line coverage from testing the application.
* Begin by implementing the `SlotsGame`, `SlotsPlayer` as well as `NumberGuessGame` and `NumberGuessPlayer` provided in the `com.github.zipcodewilmington.casino.games` package.
